Part 1:
One of the most basic problems in NLP is part-of-speech tagging, in which the goal is to mark every word in a sentence with its part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.). This is a first step
towards extracting semantics from natural language text. Using Bayes Nets, Simplified Algorithm, Variable Elimination Algorithm and Viterbi Algorithm, predicting the tags of input sentence.


Part 2: Optical Character Reader
The goal is to recognize text in image. Each image in train data is divided into smaller images. The test images then fed to the trained network and prediction is done for text present in the input image.
